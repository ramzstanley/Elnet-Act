             The most famous attraction in Badian is Kawasan Falls, a three-tiered cascade that features distinctly turquoise water. It is also one of the most famous waterfalls in the Philippines.
             There are two ways to explore the falls. One is by choosing from the various canyoneering tours and having a journey for three to six hours from Alegria to Badian, and the other is by a short trek to the waterfalls.
         </p>
         <p class ="parag">
             A canyoneering tour to Kawasan Falls is an exhilarating water adventure that takes you through towering gorges and stalactite boulders. You get to swim and rappel through the river canyons and even jump off 30-foot-high cliffs into blue pools.

          <p class ="parag">
            Bantayan Island is a small island off the coast of northern Cebu. Don’t be fooled by this sleepy fishing village, the beaches of this humble island exude the same charm and beauty as the famous Boracay Island.
         </p>
         <p class ="parag">
            The best part is, Bantayan Island is not as commercialized and crowded as Boracay. If you want a relaxing vacation by the beach and witness one of the most beautiful sunsets, Bantayan Island won’t disappoint you.
            Bantayan Island is blessed with several sprawling white-sand beaches and calm azure waters. Most of the beaches in Bantayan Island are within resorts or owned privately, but they are accessible to the public for a small fee. They are some of the best tourist spots on Bantayan Island.
         </p>
         <p class ="parag">
            Bantayan Island's Kota Beach is one of the best beaches in the Philippines. It features a sandbar and a lagoon that makes a perfect spot for wading in and sunbathing. Paradise Beach, on the other hand, is a serene stretch of white sand beach that features beautiful rock formations. 
            Bantayan Island also boasts two natural cave pools, the Ogtong Cave and the Sto. Niño Cave. A natural cold spring feeds both caves, so you can expect chilly water that's great for cooling off after a morning of beach-hopping.

         <h2>3. Witness the Grandeur of the Temple of Leah</h2>
         &nbsp;

         <p class ="parag">
             Hailed as the Taj Mahal of Cebu, the Temple of Leah has become one of the most famous landmarks in Cebu. This magnificent building is a sight to behold and a favorite spot for taking Instagram-worthy shots. 

            If you’re up for a Cebu hillside tour, the Temple of Leah is an excellent place to start. Located in the hills of Busay in Cebu City, the Temple of Leah is a towering seven-story building inspired by ancient Roman architecture.

            Said to have cost over PHP 80 Million, this grand structure boasts granite floors, Doric columns, a marble fountain, and several Grecian-style statues. 
         </p>
         <p class ="parag">
            However, its most photographed features are the two golden lions by the main stairs and the nine-foot bronze statue of Leah V. Albino-Adarna, for whom the temple was built. Similar to the Taj Mahal of India, the Temple of Leah was constructed as a symbol of the undying love of Teodorico Soriano Adarna for his late wife, Leah.

            However, unlike the Taj Mahal, the Temple of Leah is not a tomb. The 24 chambers of the Temple of Leah house the namesake's massive collection of antiques, art, Chinese jars, and books. The temple is open to the public, so be sure to stop by and be entranced by this grand gesture of love.
